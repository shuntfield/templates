Filament bulb with B22 (bayonet) base. Slight flicker on some combinations for dim and colour but change either by a few points and the flicker stops.
Increasing the PWM Frequency in Tasmota Console will reduce flicker or flashing with this lamp - anything greater than 1500 will smooth the flicker. In console "pwmfrequency 1500"
